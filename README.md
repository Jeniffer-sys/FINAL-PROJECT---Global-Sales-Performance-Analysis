# FINAL PROJECT--Global-Sales-Performance-Analysis


ðŸ“Œ Project Overview :- This project analyzes global sales performance using data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques. The Jupyter Notebook (Final_Project_Global_Sales_Performance.ipynb) demonstrates step-by-step analysis of sales data to uncover trends, insights, and performance metrics across regions, products, and time periods.
I have used this dataset from Kaggle: [Global Sales Performance Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shohinurpervezshohan/global-sales-performance-dataset)

## Objective 

  The main objective of this project is to analyze and visualize global sales performance data in order to: 

Identify the most profitable regions, products, and sales channels. 

Examine the relationship between revenue, profit, discounts, and marketing spend. 

Evaluate customer satisfaction and its impact on business growth. 

Detect trends and patterns in sales transactions for financial planning. 

Provide actionable insights to optimize profit, allocate resources effectively, and support strategic decision-making.
