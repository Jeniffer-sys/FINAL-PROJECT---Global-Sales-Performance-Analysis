# FINAL PROJECT--Global-Sales-Performance-Analysis


## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview :- This project analyzes global sales performance using data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques. The Jupyter Notebook (Final_Project_Global_Sales_Performance.ipynb) demonstrates step-by-step analysis of sales data to uncover trends, insights, and performance metrics across regions, products, and time periods.
I have used this dataset from Kaggle: [Global Sales Performance Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shohinurpervezshohan/global-sales-performance-dataset)

## Objective 

  The main objective of this project is to analyze and visualize global sales performance data in order to: 

Identify the most profitable regions, products, and sales channels. 

Examine the relationship between revenue, profit, discounts, and marketing spend. 

Evaluate customer satisfaction and its impact on business growth. 

Detect trends and patterns in sales transactions for financial planning. 

Provide actionable insights to optimize profit, allocate resources effectively, and support strategic decision-making. 

## Dataset 

The dataset comprises global sales transaction records containing key attributes such as: 

Order ID â€“ Unique identifier for each transaction 

Product Category & Sub-category â€“ Classification of products sold 

Sales Amount â€“ Total revenue generated from each order 

Profit â€“ Net gain after deducting costs 

Quantity â€“ Number of units sold 

Discount â€“ Percentage of price reduction applied 

Region / Country â€“ Geographical location of the sales 

Order Date & Ship Date â€“ Timeline of sales and delivery operations 

## Libraries Used

 For Data Loading & Manipulation 

Pandas â€“ Used for data cleaning, transformation, and structured data handling. 

NumPy â€“ Used for numerical operations and mathematical computations 

 For Data Visualization 

Matplotlib â€“ Used for creating basic charts, graphs, and data plots to represent sales trends and distributions. 

Seaborn â€“ Built on top of Matplotlib, used for advanced statistical visualizations with enhanced aesthetics. 


## Overall Summary

The document provides a comprehensive analysis of worldwide sales transactions. 

The dataset is a clean and valuable resource for financial performance and profitability analysis.
